      <h3><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21085v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CovDocker: Benchmarking Covalent Drug Design with Tasks, Datasets, and
  Solutions</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yangzhe Peng, Kaiyuan Gao, Liang He, Yuheng Cong, Haiguang Liu, Kun He, Lijun Wu</p>
      <p>Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However, most exis...</p>

  Prediction Models</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hoa La, Ahan Gupta, Alex Morehead, Jianlin Cheng, Minjia Zhang</p>
      <p>Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive operators, ...</p>

  Ocean Ridges</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Intoy, J. W. Halley</p>
      <p>We have previously shown in model studies that rapid quenches of systems of monomers interacting to form polymer chains can fix nonequilibrium chemistries which could lead to the origin of life. We suggested that such quenching processes might have occurred at very high rates on early earth, giving ...</p>

      <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmet Sarigun, Bora Uyar, Vedran Franke, Altuna Akalin</p>
      <p>Sampling physically valid ligand-binding poses remains a major challenge in molecular docking, particularly for unseen or structurally diverse targets. We introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket ex...</p>

      <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhichao Yan, Yue Kang, Buyong Ma</p>
      <p>Aptamers are single-stranded DNA/RNAs or short peptides with unique tertiary structures that selectively bind to specific targets. They have great potential in the detection and medical fields. Here, we present SelfTrans-Ensemble, a deep learning model that integrates sequence information models and...</p>

      <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Zhang, Jiaqi Wei, Zijie Qiu, Sheng Xu, Nanqing Dong, Zhiqiang Gao, Siqi Sun</p>
      <p>Peptide sequencing-the process of identifying amino acid sequences from mass spectrometry data-is a fundamental task in proteomics. Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have proven highly effective for this task, outperforming traditional methods. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate token...</p>

      <p>Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) represent a promising therapeutic avenue for human diseases, particularly in cancer treatment. Systematic elucidation of structure-activity relationships (SARs) and accurate prediction of the activity of PDCs are critical for the rational design and optimization of the...</p>

  Water</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayantan Mondal, Saumyak Mukherjee, Biman Bagchi</p>
      <p>Surface effects could play a dominant role in modifying the natural liquid order. In some cases, the effects of the surface interactions can propagate inwards, and even can interfere with a similar propagation from opposite surfaces. This can be particularly evident in liquid water under nano-confin...</p>

      <p>Cyclic peptides offer inherent advantages in pharmaceuticals. For example, cyclic peptides are more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis compared to linear peptides and usually exhibit excellent stability and affinity. Although deep generative models have achieved great success in linear peptide design...</p>
